## Performance Tracking Tool

This was a Google Spreadsheet tool that tracked physical output of a product line at each processing station. It parsed text logs to aggregate hourly statistics, wrote to a Google spreadsheet using the **Sheets API**, and used **cron scheduling** to continuously monitor progress.

This tool helped operations managers to identify process bottlebecks.

I developed this tool during an internship at an e-commerce company specialising in streetwear.
