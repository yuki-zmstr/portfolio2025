### Math 421 Abstract Algebra, Prof. James Cook, Liberty University

I've watched half the lectures before getting lost in the abstract concepts like group actions and the orbit stabilizer theorem. One advantage of learning through youtube is that I'm not under the pressure of homeworks and tests, but at the same time I don't force myself to really understand a concept before moving on. I hope to pick this up some time in the future.

### Group Theory and the Rubikâ€™s Cube, Janet Chen, Harvard University

These notes are also on group theory, with a particular application on the Rubik's Cube. I've been collecting Rubik's Cubes and their variations since around 2020, and have since learned to solve a couple of them, but I hope to understand their structures mathematically.
