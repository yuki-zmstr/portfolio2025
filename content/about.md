I earned my Bachelor's degree at the National University of Singapore in Industrial & Systems Engineering (ISE). In ISE, I studied methods to analyse systems and processes, including machine learning, statistical hypothesis testing, and linear programming.

A key highlight of my degree was a one-year industrial attachment where students worked with companies to solve real-world problems. I was attached to Abbott Laboratories, Singapore, where I developed a data aggregation tool that collected and cleaned 'spin-rate' data from milk powder drying plants and summarised key statistics in a PowerBI Dashboard. The data processing logic was implemented in Python as a Jupyter notebook, accompanied with a PDF user manual describing how to operate and customise the code.

Through this attachment, I learned about the importance of user-centric tool design. In addition to adding graphics in the manual, I annotated the Jupyter Notebook with code comments so that others can easily understand and extend the tool. This experience has had a lasting impact on my work attitude - I continue to priotise code readability and thorough, human-friendly documentation.

In addition to my major, I pursused a minor in Mathematics. Some courses I took were [Discrete Mathematics](https://nusmods.com/courses/MA1100/basic-discrete-mathematics), [Advanced Linear Algebra](https://nusmods.com/courses/MA2101/linear-algebra-ii) and [Graph Theory](https://nusmods.com/courses/MA3233/combinatorics-and-graphs-ii). Discovering how one can start from basic definitions and work towards significant theorems has been truely inspiring, and continues to fuel my interest in theoretical and applied mathematics.
